# EventTrackerProject

#Description
This event tracker project was the beginning of a 3 weekend project. The first weekend was setting up CRUD operations using REST API. My goal is to track locations I have visited around the world and include a picture or two from every locations. My wife and I love to travel so I think this will be a fun project to keep up with even once this course is complete.

#Lessons Learned
I have gained a better understanding of RESTful services after this project. I fell behind during the lesson because I became sick but after this weekend project I feel like I am caught up.

#Technologies Used
Java, REST, JPA, and Postman

#What was fun?
This weekend was mothers day weekend so it was a quick and painless project that only took a few hours to complete. I was able to complete the project and have time to enjoy Mothers Day with my wife and kids. I am excited to expand on this project and idea over the next couple weekends.
